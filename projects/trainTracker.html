            This is a live led map that displays where each train 
            is on one of Chicago's train routes. I was 
            inspired by <a href="https://www.traintrackr.io/">traintrackr</a> 
            maps and wanted to build my own on a smaller scale.

          Each pixel has four pins: VCC, GND, DIN, and DOUT. The DOUT of one pixel is connected to 
          the DIN of another pixel, so the microcontroller only needs to send bits to the first pixel 
          in the display to control all of them. The color and brightness of a pixel is determined by 
          the 24 bits that are sent to it. 
        </p>
        <img src="../img/ws2812bRGBData.png">
        <p>
          How the pixel determines if a bit is a 0 or 1 is by the number of nanoseconds DIN 
          is high then low.

          Initally, I tried to use Expressif's ESP-IDF GPIO driver to controll the pin outputs, but when 
          measuring how fast the ESP32 pins could switch from high to low and low to high, it was 
          much too slow for the pixels. I had to directly change the bits of the microcontroller's registers, who
          addresses can be found in the  
          <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf">technical reference manual</a>.
          I then added nops to delay clock cycles for better timing.

          I used the ESP32 for this project for its built-in WiFi support, allowing me to request 
          train data from Chicago Transit Authority's (CTA) 
          <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/ttdocs/#locations">API</a>. 
          From that data I knew which station each active train on the blue line was at or heading towards. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To light up the pixels I created an array that could store 198 16-bit numbers, 3 for each 
          of the 66 pixels that controlled how much green, red, and blue a pixel will 
          emit and that can be set from 0 to 255. That array is then turned into a binary signal that 
          is output from a valid pin.

          As I was coding I kept in mind that I might want to extend this project to include other lines of Chicago's 
          metro system. So if I wanted to add other tracks it could be done fairly easily and none of the existing methods would 
          have to be modified.
