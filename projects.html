            Chicago Blue Line Train Tracker
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            An LED display of Chicago's Blue Line that indicates 
            which stations a train is currently at. I used an ESP32-WROVER 
            dev board to send a request every few seconds to CTA's API for 
            each train's current position. The microcontroller then parses 
            that information and sends the appropriate bits to the pixels.
            Each pair of pixels is a station on the Blue Line. The innermost
            line of pixels are for the trains heading South, and the outermost 
            are for the trains heading North.

            Handwired Mechanical Keyboard
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            After taking an interest in mechanical keyboards I wondered if 
            I could wire and program my own. I took red Kailh box switches,  
            sodered them into a matrix, and connected them to a Rasberry Pi 
            Pico. The Pico scans the matrix to register and print out keystrokes.

            Automatic Trash Collector
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            This was a project for my Intro to Engineering Design class that I 
            worked on with 6 other students. It is an automatic trash 
            collecting robot that uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 object 
            detection model to detect trash. When it detects trash, it calculates 
            how far it is, moves to it, and uses its grabber to pick it up 
            and dump it in the bin.

            Self-driving Car
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            This was a project for my Embedded Control class where I programmed the 
            MSP430 on this RSLK robotic car to navigate through a maze with PID control. 
            It takes readings from an ultrasonic sensor, a compass, and bumpers to avoid 
            obstacles and adjust its position as it drives.

            Heart Rate Detector
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            This circuit detects a hearbeat by measuring the differences 
            in light that pass through a finger. The small signal from the 
            infrared transistor is fed to amplifiers and filters. The output 
            is connected to LEDs that light up depending on the frequency of 
            the heart rate. The yellow LED lights up whenever it detects a 
            heartbeat, and the red LED only blinks when the heart rate is within 
            the normal resting human heart rate (between 60-100 beats per minute).

            Line Follower
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            This line follower is made up of two 555 timers that each control a motor. 
            The duty cycle of the PWM signals generated by the astable 555 timers changes 
            depending on how much light from the LED reaches the photoresistor. The difference 
            in how much light is reflected between a black and white surface changes the 
            average voltage of the PWM signals that is proportional to the speed of the wheels.
