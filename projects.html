            Chicago Blue Line Train Tracker
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            An LED display of Chicago's Blue Line that indicates 
            which stations a train is currently at. I used an ESP32-WROVER 
            dev board to send a request every few seconds to CTA's API for 
            each train's current position. The microcontroller then parses 
            that information and sends the appropriate bits to the pixels.
            Each pair of pixels is a station on the Blue Line. The innermost
            line of pixels are for the trains heading South, and the outermost 
            are for the trains heading North.

            Handwired Mechanical Keyboard
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            After taking an interest in mechanical keyboards I wondered if 
            I could wire and program my own. I took red Kailh box switches,  
            sodered them into a matrix, and connected them to a Rasberry Pi 
            Pico. The Pico scans the matrix and reads any keystrokes.

            Automatic Trash Collector
          </h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            This was a project for my Intro to Engineering Design class that I 
            worked on with 6 other students. It is an automatic trash 
            collecting robot that uses the Ultralytics YOLOv8 object 
            detection model to detect trash. When it detects trash, it calculates 
            how far it is, moves to it, and uses its grabber to pick it up 
            and dump it in the bin.
