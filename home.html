            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Emily Stomper Garcia. I am a student at RPI 
              pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Computer 
              Engineering. Through my coursework I have developed a 
              solid understanding of programming principles and computer 
              architecture. I have experience programming in C, C++, and 
              Python, and am familiar with data structures and algorithms. 
              Balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a part-time 
              job has taught me how to manage my time efficiently, and 
              how to prioritize my tasks. 

              I am excited to begin my career as an engineer and to use 
              my skills to contribute to meaningful projects.
